# Typing Speed Website

I am trying to build a website to learn JS.
Being somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS and Python I wanted to build a website that would allow me to practice typing.

## Front End 

I plan to go Top-Down, starting with UI and building the backend later.
The UI should look sleek, clean and modern. This project will ultize [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) for it's theme.

## Back End

I want to use Python for the backend. Something that can locally store, anaylsis and process the data. 
This means that the front end logic will be handled by JS which is not a language I am familiar with. So it will be an interesting experiment.
